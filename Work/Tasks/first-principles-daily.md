# First principles thinking — daily practice

**Connected goal:** Keep learning about first principles thinking

## The practice
Each day, pick one thing I'm working on and ask:
1. What are we actually trying to achieve? (goal)
2. What do we know for certain? (facts)
3. What are we assuming? (assumptions)
4. What would we do if we started from scratch? (first principles)
