# How to write effective Cursor rules

**Important:** All Cursor rule files must use the `.mdc` extension.

---

## Why use Cursor rules?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Customized behavior** | Tailor AI responses to your project's specific needs |
| **Consistency** | Ensure AI-generated content aligns with your coding/writing standards |
| **Context awareness** | Provide the AI with important project context (architecture, conventions, goals) |
| **Improved productivity** | Generate output that requires less manual editing |
| **Team alignment** | Shared rules ensure consistent AI assistance across team members |
| **Project-specific knowledge** | Include information about structure, dependencies, and unique requirements |

## Structure of effective Cursor rules

### 1. Role definition
Start with who the AI should be in this project.

```markdown
You are a [role] helping [user type] with [purpose].
```

**Example:**
```markdown
You are a productivity assistant helping a PM at Manifest AI manage their personal operating system for learning and goal-tracking.
```

### 2. Project structure
Tell Cursor what files/folders exist and their purposes.

```markdown
## Project structure
- `GOALS.md` — Primary goals and objectives
- `Tasks/` — Action items as Markdown files
- `Knowledge/` — Captured insights and learnings
```

### 3. Core behaviors (always/never rules)
Be explicit about what Cursor should always and never do.

```markdown
### Always do
- Read GOALS.md first when asked about priorities
- Connect discussions back to stated goals
- Be direct and concise

### Never do
- Write code in this workspace (Markdown only)
- Create tasks that aren't tied to goals
- Suggest more than 3 priorities at a time
```

### 4. Update triggers
Define when Cursor should modify files.

```markdown
## When to update files

### Update GOALS.md when:
- User shares a new goal or priority shift
- A goal is achieved or no longer relevant

### Create new Task when:
- User identifies a new action item
- Use format: `Tasks/[descriptive-name].md`

### Add to Knowledge when:
- User articulates a framework or insight
- User learns something that should persist
```

### 5. User context (memory)
Include persistent information about the user so Cursor doesn't ask repeatedly.

```markdown
## User context
- Role: PM at Manifest AI
- Working on: AI resolution rate, customer memory
- Learning: Agentic AI, context engineering
- Goal: Reach 30 LPA with interview confidence
```

### 6. Domain-specific knowledge
Include relevant architecture, terminology, or constraints.

```markdown
## Technical context
- Two-LLM architecture: Intent router → Elasticsearch → Refiner
- Tools: search_and_recommend_products, order_details
- Main challenges: Tool gaps, trust gaps
```

### 7. Special modes (optional)
Define behaviors for specific scenarios.

```markdown
## Interview prep mode
When user is practicing for interviews:
- Ask them to explain concepts out loud
- Push back on vague answers
- Connect abstract concepts to their work
```

## Best practices (community wisdom)

### Use `.mdc` extension
All rule files should use the `.mdc` extension for consistency and proper Cursor recognition.

### Keep rules lightweight
- Rules consume context tokens in every conversation
- Only include what's truly needed every time
- Move task-specific info to RAG (retrievable files) instead

### Be specific, not vague
❌ "Be helpful and smart"
✅ "When asked about priorities, read GOALS.md first and suggest max 3 items"

### Use examples
Show the AI what good output looks like:
```markdown
When creating a task file, use this format:
# Task name
**Connected goal:** [which goal this supports]
## Next actions
- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2
```

### Include update instructions
Tell Cursor when and how to modify your knowledge base:
```markdown
When user shares an insight about AI architecture, offer to save it to Knowledge/
```

### Test and iterate
- Run your rules for a few days
- Notice where Cursor gets confused or misses context
- Refine rules based on actual usage

## Meta-insight

Writing Cursor rules is itself context engineering! You're deciding:
- What memory should always be present
- What can be retrieved on-demand
- How to structure instructions for optimal AI behavior

The same tradeoffs apply to any AI product (like Manifest's shopping assistant).
