# Life OS — PARA Framework

This is my personal operating system built on Tiago Forte's **PARA Method**.

Everything in my life is organized into four categories based on **actionability**, not topic.

---

## Structure

### Projects/
Active, short-term efforts with **specific goals and deadlines**.
Each project has a clear outcome and timeline.

| Project | Target | Deadline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Career 30 LPA | Reach 30 LPA compensation | Next role/negotiation |
| Weight Loss 15KG | Lose 15 KG | August 2026 |
| 20 Books 2026 | Read 20 books this year | December 2026 |
| Concert Photography | Get into concert photography | December 2026 |
| Skin Health | Transform skin health | June 2026 |
| Fashion Upgrade | Build intentional personal style | Ongoing through 2026 |

### Areas/
Ongoing spheres of responsibility with **standards to maintain**, no end date.
- Health & Fitness
- Career & Work
- Personal Development
- Photography
- Style & Grooming

### Resources/
Topics of interest and **reference material** collected for future use.
- Reading List & Book Notes
- Asymmetric Returns / Mental Models
- Photography Techniques
- Fitness & Nutrition Science
- Skincare Knowledge
- Fashion & Style Guides

### Archives/
Completed projects, inactive areas, or resources no longer needed.
Items are moved here, never deleted.

### Daily/
The daily tasklist generation system. Contains templates and the logic the Cursor rule uses to generate varied, goal-connected daily plans.

## How It Works

1. **Every goal lives as a Project** with milestones, metrics, and weekly targets
2. **Areas maintain the habits** that support projects (health, career, growth)
3. **Resources feed knowledge** into projects and areas
4. **The Cursor rule** reads this structure and generates a daily tasklist that:
   - Covers all active projects proportionally
   - Varies by weekday vs weekend
   - Rotates activities to stay fun
   - Connects every task back to a goal

## Key Principle

> "Organize by actionability, not by topic. Break areas into projects. Projects create momentum." — Tiago Forte
