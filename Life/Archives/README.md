# Archives

Completed projects, inactive areas, and resources no longer in active use.

Items are **moved** here from Projects/, Areas/, or Resources/ — never deleted.

## How to archive
1. Move the file from its current PARA folder to Archives/
2. Add a note at the top: `**Archived:** [date] — [reason]`
3. That's it. You can always retrieve it later.

## Currently empty
This is good. It means everything is active and in motion.
