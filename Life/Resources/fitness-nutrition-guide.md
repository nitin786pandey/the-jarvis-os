## Weight Loss Fundamentals

### The only rule that matters
**Calories In < Calories Out = Weight Loss**

Everything else (keto, intermittent fasting, paleo) is just a strategy to achieve this.

### Caloric deficit targets
| Weekly loss target | Daily deficit needed |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 0.5 KG/week | ~500 cal/day |
| 0.75 KG/week | ~750 cal/day |
| 1 KG/week | ~1000 cal/day (aggressive, not sustainable) |

**Recommended:** 500–700 cal/day deficit for sustainable loss.

- Fish (salmon, tuna)
- Whey protein (supplement if needed)

### Foods to minimize

### Hydration
- 3L water/day minimum

## Recovery
