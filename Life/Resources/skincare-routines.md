## The Basics

### Skin types
| Type | Signs | Approach |
|------|-------|----------|
| Oily | Shiny, enlarged pores, prone to acne | Lightweight products, salicylic acid |
| Dry | Tight, flaky, rough texture | Rich moisturizers, hyaluronic acid |
| Combination | Oily T-zone, dry cheeks | Zone-specific treatment |
| Sensitive | Redness, irritation, reactive | Fragrance-free, minimal ingredients |
| Normal | Balanced, few issues | Maintenance routine |

### The order matters
**AM:** Cleanser → Toner → Serum → Moisturizer → Sunscreen
**PM:** Double Cleanse → Toner → Treatment → Moisturizer

## Key Ingredients & What They Do

| Ingredient | Benefit | When to use | Note |
|-----------|---------|-------------|------|
| Vitamin C | Brightening, antioxidant | AM | Use under sunscreen |
| Niacinamide | Pore-minimizing, texture | AM or PM | Gentle, works for all |
| Retinol | Anti-aging, cell turnover | PM only | Start slow (2x/week) |
| Hyaluronic acid | Hydration | AM and PM | Apply on damp skin |
| Salicylic acid (BHA) | Acne, blackheads | PM | Don't overuse |
| AHA (Glycolic/Lactic) | Exfoliation, brightening | PM, 2x/week | Not with retinol |
| SPF 50 | Sun protection | AM, always | THE most important product |
| Centella Asiatica | Soothing, healing | PM | Great for irritation |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Skipping sunscreen (causes more aging than anything else)
- Over-exfoliating (damages skin barrier)
- Using too many actives at once (introduce one at a time)
- Touching your face throughout the day
- Not patch-testing new products
- Expecting overnight results (give products 4–6 weeks)
