## The Capsule Wardrobe Concept

Own fewer, better pieces. Everything should work together. Quality over quantity.

### Core formula
**30 items that create 100+ outfits:**
- 5 bottoms (jeans, chinos, trousers)
- 8 tops (tees, shirts, henleys)
- 4 outerwear (jacket, blazer, hoodie, light layer)
- 4 shoes (sneakers, boots, loafers, one dressy)
- 4 accessories (watch, sunglasses, belt, bag)
- 5 basics (underwear, socks — invest in quality)

## Color Theory for Men

### Safe base colors (bottoms, outerwear)
Navy, charcoal, black, olive, beige/khaki

### Accent colors (tops, accessories)
White, light blue, burgundy, forest green, burnt orange

### Rule of three
Never wear more than 3 colors at once. Two is often better.

### Indian skin tone tips
- Rich jewel tones work well (deep blue, emerald, maroon)
- Earth tones (olive, brown, beige) are versatile
- Avoid washed-out pastels unless contrasted
- White and navy are universal winners

## Fit Guide

| Item | How it should fit |
|------|------------------|
| T-shirt | Shoulder seam at shoulder bone, not too tight on arms |
| Shirt | Can fit two fingers in collar, sleeves end at wrist bone |
| Jeans/Pants | Sits at waist, no bunching at crotch, slight taper |
| Jacket | Shoulder seam at shoulder, can button without pulling |
| Shoes | Half thumb-width of space at toe |

## Style Archetypes (pick elements you like)

| Style | Key pieces | Vibe |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Minimal | Clean lines, neutral colors, simple | Confident, modern |
| Smart casual | Chinos + button-down + clean sneakers | Professional but approachable |
| Streetwear | Oversized tees, sneakers, layering | Creative, youthful |
| Classic | Oxford shirts, loafers, tailored pants | Timeless, mature |

## Shopping Rules
1. Never impulse buy — sleep on it overnight
2. Cost per wear: A $3000 jacket worn 200 times = $15/wear (worth it)
3. Buy one quality item > three cheap ones
4. Try everything on — fit trumps brand
5. Build slowly — 1–2 new pieces per month max
