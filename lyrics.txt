You're Welcome (from Moana)

[Verse 1]
I see what's happening, yeah
You're face-to-face with a founder raising seed stage
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change

[Chorus]
What can I say except you're welcome
For the VCs, the stock, the IPO
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
