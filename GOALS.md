# Goals

## Life System

All personal goals are tracked in the **Life/** folder using the PARA framework.
See `Life/README.md` for the full structure and `Life/Projects/` for active goals.

The Cursor rule at `.cursor/rules/life-daily-tasklist.mdc` generates daily tasklists from these goals.

## Active projects at Manifest AI

### 1. Increase AI resolution rate
- **Goal:** Reduce AI → Human agent handover %
- **Levers to explore:**
  - Better context engineering (what info does the AI need?)
  - Model selection (is the current model good enough for complex queries?)
  - Tool coverage (are there queries we can't handle because we lack tools?)
  - Confidence calibration (when should AI escalate vs. attempt?)

### 2. Long-term customer memory
- **Goal:** Save and reuse customer context across sessions
- **Questions to answer:**
  - What should persist? (preferences, past orders, stated needs)
  - What's the cost of memory in context window?
  - How do we handle memory decay/updates?

## Learning goals
- First principles thinking — practice daily
- Deepen understanding of agentic AI architectures
- Build vocabulary to explain technical concepts simply
- Read 20 books focused on asymmetric returns / compounding ideas
