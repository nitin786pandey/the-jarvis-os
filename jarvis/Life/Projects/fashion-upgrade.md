**Timeline:** Ongoing through 2026
**Approach:** Learn the basics → build a capsule wardrobe → develop personal taste

---

## Why This Matters
How you present yourself affects confidence, first impressions, and how seriously people take you. This isn't vanity — it's leverage. Looking put-together is an asymmetric return: small effort, outsized impact.

## Phase 1: Learn the Fundamentals (Feb–Mar 2026)

- [ ] Understand your body type and what fits well
- [ ] Learn color theory basics (what colors suit your skin tone)
- [ ] Study the concept of a capsule wardrobe
- [ ] Identify 3 style icons / references you resonate with
- [ ] Wardrobe audit: remove what doesn't fit, is damaged, or you never wear

## Phase 2: Build the Capsule (Apr–Jun 2026)

### Core pieces to acquire
- [ ] Well-fitting dark jeans (2 pairs)
- [ ] Chinos / tailored trousers (2 pairs — navy, beige/olive)
- [ ] White sneakers (clean, minimal)
- [ ] Chelsea boots or desert boots
- [ ] Plain t-shirts that fit perfectly (3–4 in neutral colors)
- [ ] Oxford/button-down shirts (2–3)
- [ ] A good jacket/blazer (casual)
- [ ] A quality watch (simple, classic)
- [ ] Sunglasses that suit your face shape

### Fit rules
- Shoulders should end at your shoulder bone
- No excess fabric bunching at waist
- Pants should break just at the shoe (no pooling)
- Sleeves should show 1–2 cm of shirt cuff under jacket

## Phase 3: Develop Taste (Jul–Dec 2026)

- [ ] Experiment with textures, layers, and accessories
- [ ] Develop a "signature" element (a watch, a jacket style, a color)
- [ ] Dress intentionally every day — even WFH
- [ ] Monthly: Take a mirror photo to track style evolution

## Daily Habit
**Every morning:** Spend 2 minutes choosing an intentional outfit. No default "grab whatever" days.

## Weekly Habit
**30 min/week:** Browse style content (Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube) for inspiration. Save to a mood board.
