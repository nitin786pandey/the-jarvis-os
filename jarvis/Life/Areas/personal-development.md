## What "good" looks like
- Reading consistently (not in bursts)
- Capturing and connecting ideas across books
- Thinking in mental models, not just facts
- Applying what I learn, not just consuming
- Journaling or reflecting regularly

| Journaling | 3x/week | Evening (5–10 min) |

## Core mental models to internalize
(Naval Ravikant / Charlie Munger / asymmetric returns thinking)

- **Specific knowledge:** Find what feels like play to you but work to others
- **Leverage:** Code, media, capital, labor — use the first two
- **Compounding:** Small consistent actions > sporadic big efforts
- **Inversion:** What would guarantee failure? Avoid that
- **Opportunity cost:** Every yes is a no to something else
- **Skin in the game:** Only trust advice from people with consequences
- **Long-term games with long-term people:** Relationships and reputation compound

## What I'm optimizing for
Not just knowledge acquisition, but **wisdom** — the ability to apply the right knowledge at the right time.
