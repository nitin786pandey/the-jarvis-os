## Naval Ravikant — Core Ideas

### On Wealth
- **Seek wealth, not money or status.** Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.
- **You're not going to get rich renting out your time.** You must own equity — a piece of a business — to gain financial freedom.
- **Specific knowledge** is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity, not what's hot right now. It can't be trained; if it could be, someone else would be trained to do it.
- **Leverage:** The three forms — labor, capital, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). The last two are permissionless.
- **Play long-term games with long-term people.** All returns in life — wealth, relationships, knowledge — come from compound interest.

### On Judgment
- **Clear thinking is the real superpower.** It's not taught in school; it's practiced in silence.
- **The most important skill is knowing how to learn.** Read broadly, think deeply.
- **Read what you love until you love to read.**
- **Foundational books > trending books.** Math, science, philosophy — these are the roots.

### On Happiness
- **Happiness is a skill, not a circumstance.** It's the absence of desire, the state of not wanting more.
- **Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.**
- **A calm mind, a fit body, a house full of love.** These things cannot be bought — they must be earned.

## Asymmetric Return Patterns

| Reading widely | One insight can change your trajectory | Books on mental models |
| Health investment | 1 hour of exercise = 10x return in energy | Daily workouts |
| Skill stacking | Combining 2–3 skills makes you rare | PM + AI + Photography |
| Network effects | Each relationship can unlock unexpected doors | Concert photography community |
| Consistency | Most people quit; just showing up is an edge | Daily routines |
