## The Exposure Triangle

| Setting | What it controls | Concert tip |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Aperture** (f-stop) | Depth of field, light | Use f/1.4–f/2.8 for low light |
| **Shutter Speed** | Motion blur, light | 1/200+ to freeze action, 1/60 for artistic blur |
| **ISO** | Sensor sensitivity, noise | Push to 3200–6400 in concerts; accept some grain |

## Concert Photography Essentials

### Settings cheat sheet
- Mode: Manual or Aperture Priority
- Aperture: As wide as your lens allows (f/1.8 ideal)
- Shutter: 1/160–1/250 for sharp shots
- ISO: Auto ISO with max 6400
- Focus: Continuous AF (AI Servo/AF-C)
- Drive: Continuous/burst shooting
- Metering: Spot metering (lights change fast)
- White balance: Auto (fix in post)

### Composition tips for concerts
- **Rule of thirds** — place the artist at intersections
- **Leading lines** — use stage elements, light beams
- **Negative space** — don't always fill the frame
- **Crowd shots** — tell the story of the atmosphere
- **Silhouettes** — backlit performers are dramatic
- **Details** — hands on instruments, sweat, tattoos
- **Wide vs tight** — mix establishing shots with close-ups

### Venue etiquette
- Respect the 3-song rule (shoot first 3 songs, no flash)
- Don't block audience view
- Stay in the photo pit if assigned one
- Be quick and quiet with gear
- Always credit the artist/venue when posting

2. **Manual mode week** — shoot everything in manual for a week
3. **One lens challenge** — use only one focal length for a week
4. **Golden hour shoots** — practice with beautiful natural light
5. **Low light practice** — shoot in dimly lit cafes, streets at night
