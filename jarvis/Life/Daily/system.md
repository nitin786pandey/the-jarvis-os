# Daily Tasklist Generation System

This file defines how the Cursor rule generates daily tasklists that cover all goals proportionally, vary by day, and stay fun to follow.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Every task connects to a goal** — no busywork
2. **Varied rotation** — different focus areas on different days prevents burnout
3. **Weekday vs Weekend** — weekdays are efficient, weekends are exploratory
4. **Non-negotiables first** — certain habits happen daily regardless
5. **3-priority cap** — max 3 "big wins" per day, rest is maintenance
6. **Fun factor** — include something enjoyable every day

| Habit | Time | Goal it serves |
|-------|------|---------------|
| AM skincare routine | Morning, 10 min | Skin Health |
| PM skincare routine | Evening, 10 min | Skin Health |
| Drink 3L water | Throughout day | Weight Loss + Skin |
| 10,000 steps | Throughout day | Weight Loss |
| Track meals/calories | After each meal | Weight Loss |
| Intentional outfit | Morning, 2 min | Fashion |
| Read 15–20 pages | Morning or evening | 20 Books |
